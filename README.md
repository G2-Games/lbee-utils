## Acknowledgments
The implementations for decompression of CZ1, CZ3, and CZ4 were derived from
[GARbro](https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/). The implementation of decompression
for CZ2, and compression of CZ1, CZ3, and CZ4 was derived from the
implementation in [LuckSystem](https://github.com/wetor/LuckSystem).
This project would not have been possible without their amazing work.
